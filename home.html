	<h1>Bluetooth Speaker Personas and Storyboard</h1>
	<img class="sketch" src="sketch.png">
	<p>
		This is the "Boxanne" bluetooth speaker. It can wirelessly connect to a phone or computer and play audio. It also has buttons that allow for limited audio control. Note that all of the buttons on the top panel have multiple functions.
	</p>
	<h2>User Testing</h2>
	<p>I observed and interviewed three users as they interacted with the speaker. Each user was asked to pair their phone with the speaker, and then to play a song, increase the volume, and pause the song.</p>
	<p>Each user was able to pair without issue, but all three of them accidentally skipped the song when asked to change the volume. This issue occurred because the same button is used to skip the song and to change the volume. Beyond that, the first two users were quickly able to accomplish everything else without issue. The third user accidentally called their mother instead of pausing the song, because the same button is used to call and to pause the music. </p>
	<p>I then asked each user the same set of questions.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Was there anything unexpected with your experience?</li>
		<li>Was there anything you found difficult about the speaker?</li>
		<li>What were you looking for when trying to pair your phone with the speaker?</li>
		<li>What were you looking for when you wanted to change the volume?</li>
		<li>What were you looking for when attempting to pause the music?</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Each user pointed out that the song skipping instead of changing the volume was unexpected, while the third user also noted that they did not intend to call their mother. Everyone also pointed out that they expected to see a bluetooth button that would initiate pairing, however the speaker began pairing automatically when it was turned on, and there is no bluetooth button. None of the users ended their sessions with a complete understanding of exactly how to press the volume button "correctly," although they were successfully able to change the volume some of the time.</p>
	<h2>Personas</h2>
	<p>Based on the interviews, I came up with personas that represent two archetypes of users that will interact with the speaker.</p>
	<h4>Anxious Aaron</h4>
	<p>Anxious Aaron is a nervous person who feels that he needs to impress his friends in order to fit in. When it comes to the bluetooth speaker, he wants to play the perfect music that will lead to his friends having a great time. The problem is that the buttons on the speaker all have multiple functions, which will lead to him skipping the song his friend likes when heâ€™s asked to turn up the volume.</p>
	<h4>Deliberate Daniel</h4>
	<p>Deliberate Daniel is an engineering student who likes to investigate every piece of technology he gets his hands on. When he first gets a bluetooth speaker, he tests out every feature in order to understand how it works. In the case of this speaker, it is necessary, since without a manual, it is only possible to learn to use the buttons that have multiple functions through trial and error.</p>
